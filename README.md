## Updating content

The English homepage can be edited by opening `index.md` and clicking on the `Edit this file` button.
- It's written in Markdown.
- [Here's a 2-page PDF that contains syntax examples](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf). 

If you want to add additional site translations, go to `_translations` and duplicate `es.md`.
- With `es.md `, `es` defines the URL as `my-website.org/es`.
- Inside the file, `language-name: Español` sets the language's display name as `Español`.
- `language-code: es_LA` helps search engines recognize the page's language.
- The list of languages is automatically populated by the files inside  `_translations`.
